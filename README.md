Hammy’s Adventures!
Directions for gameplay:
Our game, “Hammy’s Adventures!”, includes 5 levels, all taking place in various locations where
you have to navigate the hamster through obstacles to reach the other side. Each of the 5 levels
contains 3 varying levels of difficulty. This difficulty determines how quickly your health drains
- level 1 difficulty has a much slower health drain while for level 3 difficulty if you make more
than a few mistakes you are likely to die. The difficulty is controlled by success - if you pass the
level, the difficulty for the next level increases, and if you fail the level, the difficulty drops
down.
If your health drains to 0, you lose a life and are brought back to the beginning of the current
level. Once you have lost all your lives, you are brought back to the beginning of level one to
restart the game. Eating cheese acts as a health boost!
In order to navigate our hamster as he is rolling in his ball, press play, and begin in level one.
Use either the arrow keys or aswd keys to move in any direction. The space bar provides a jump.
For extra help on certain levels, you can scroll the camera in and out by using the scroll on your
mouse.
There are also coins laying around that act as a scoring system, collect as many as you can to try
and beat the previous high score!
You win the game by navigating Hammy the Hamster through all 5 levels! Good luck!
